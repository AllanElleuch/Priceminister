# Priceminister

This project was both part of an academic work and a contest created by the Rakuten group. 

The objective was to find a solution to identify review that help other users in their decision to buy an article. 

To achieve this I used machine learning based on the Random Forest and SVM model. 

A model of predicting helpfulness in reviews was developed with an accuracy of 65% on Priceminister reviews.  The most important features were review length, polarity score, TFIDF and readability score

# Visualisation

During my work I drew different graph to visualise the distribution of the data and help me making the right choice in the development of the model.
